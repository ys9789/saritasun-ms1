								<p class="animate-box">It was a challenge for me to go from architecture to interactive, or technological design. In the past few years of studying, my thinking about design concepts has continually broken and changed. The brain dynamic leads to a fact that I was unable to persuade myself to go directly to a deeper and more focused research area. The dilemma does not mean I completely changed my interests, or I do not want to continue learning in school. On the contrary, my love for architecture has only been increasing, but it has become a thinking methodology to help me to work with design in general. </p>
                
								<p class="animate-box">The study process of architecture design in my undergrads, such as researching widely and constructing architectural models through old-fashioned ways like hand-drafting, sewing, and hand-making of models, has built me an integrated thinking system of design in general. It is a system of creating stuff through a way of combining the philosophical meaning of the historical and cultural backgrounds and immersing them with the environmental context. However, later in my experience at Sci-arc architecture studio during a summer has shown me an entirely different approach to creating forms. </p>
                
								<p class="animate-box">“You don’t always need to add such background or philosophical points in your process. Here, the design does not require background meaning or stories, the design is just design, and meaning could be something to be added after,” one of my instructors at Sci-arc said this to me during a group critique after I presented my idea of how I build my model based on a philosophical point. “If there’s no background in this piece, which means there is no meaning, why do we do it? What does it mean by ‘design?’” I asked the question. “It’s just different ways of teaching and thinking.” He answered. This is completely different from what I have been doing all the time about designing because I always build things on top of learning the historical background or exploring a philosophical meaning that could be used as a basic principle. Here, however, their use of simple form, design philosophy, technology, and software without the need of playing with any meanings, history, or cultural background challenged my previous understanding of design. </p>
                
								<p class="animate-box">Since then, I have been thinking and tangling with the method of design all the time. I love designs that come from the ways of studying historical and cultural backgrounds, but at the same time, I do not want to only stick with that. I believe a design world without a story would not be able to able to do anything for people. I started to try to find a new way that could combine two of the ideas. I began to be interested in a more and wider design range especially how can designs impact people. Matching with different disciplines becomes the most mysterious puzzle I always try to solve. I resolutely decided to try different kinds of design projects to find a potential path, so I looked for many different opportunities to explore. I tried VR and game making, parametric design, interactive and multimedia design, and even software and web designs by attending different classes, arranging group works with other people, and doing relevant jobs. For every project, however, I tried to promote the design projects from the concept of "people" and "for people". </p>
                
								<p class="animate-box">I always spend a lot of time constructing my concepts, and it seems that if I make my thoughts and logic work smoothly in my brain, they would be achieved easily. However, when I have completed all my brain-work compositions and went on to execute them, I got tortured by decent amounts of inestimable difficulties. How can I make the result as good as my in-brain concept? The experience of working at an installation company gave me the answer. Working with hardware and physical production taught me how important it is "to do" and "to try" instead of only working in my brain. As I get more involved in interactive design projects, I'm getting more and more obsessed with "testing" and "adjustment." The hardware is constant but working with different combinations of them as while as coding always brings unexpected results. The “unpredictables” are the most challenging part of the work. The exploration of problem-solving gives me unlimited motivations and inspirations, and this is one of the most important reasons why I choose the direction of technological designs.  </p>
                
								<p class="animate-box">To me, architecture study is a way of logical thinking. It gives me the fundamental methodology of concept building. What I want is to use this combination of conceptual construction with historical and cultural influence, and technical skills to "solve problems" for people. There must be some ways to bring the historical and cultural oriented design together with the evolution of science and technology, and I see this possibility in the interactive design world. Science and technology serve people and would help achieve a higher civilization, but that would not work without the use of knowledge of history, culture, or the pursuit of the philosophical truth of the world. I would love to learn and be part of the process of achieving this abstract future.	</p>
